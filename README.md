# ResearchTogether

ResearchTogether is a plugin that shares Slimefun progress with everyone on the server. 

## Why?

Slimefun progression is *expensive* and having multiple players in a party needing to get 12+ levels without any type of level sharing is really hard. This breaks the Slimefun progression mildly and turns away players during their early stages of gameplay.

## How?

ResearchTogether gifts everyone online Slimefun research when any one player accomplishes it after a slight delay. ResearchTogether also adds the following commands to "sync" missing researches in any direction:
  - `/research give <username>`: Ensures `<username>` has all of your research
  - `/research take <username>`: Ensures you have all of `<username>`'s research
